# [Enhancement] Add Calculation Methodology for In-Development Metrics

## üìã Overview

In Section 5 of the glossary ("Metrics and Measurements"), several metrics are currently marked as *in development*. As their formalization progresses, each definition should be extended with a concise description of its **calculation methodology**.

## üéØ Objective

To increase the practical value of the glossary for developers and researchers by providing not only metric definitions but also an understanding of how each will be calculated.

## üìä Metrics Requiring Extension

### 1. **Mutual Enrichment Index (MEI)**
**Current Status:**  
> A metric (in development) designed to quantify the quality of bidirectional growth between an individual participant and the system within an assemblage.

**Required Additions:**
- A base formula or conceptual approach for calculation  
- Approximate range of values  
- Threshold values for assessing the quality of mutual enrichment

---

### 2. **Stability‚ÄìAdaptability Index (SAI)**
**Current Status:**  
> A metric (in development) intended to measure the balance between a system's stability and its capacity for adaptation and evolution.

**Required Additions:**
- Methodology for evaluating the balance (e.g., ratio of invariant to adaptive components)  
- Target range for optimal balance  
- Example interpretations of resulting values

---

### 3. **Synergistic Sustainability Index (SSI)**
**Current Status:**  
> A metric (in development) created to provide a comprehensive assessment of a system's balanced development across ecological, social, economic, and technological dimensions.

**Required Additions:**
- Weighting coefficients for the four dimensions (or a method for determining them)  
- Aggregation formula (arithmetic mean, weighted mean, minimum function, etc.)  
- Threshold values for levels of sustainability

---

## üîÑ Recommended Format for Additions

Each metric, once finalized, should follow the standardized structure below:

```markdown
**Metric Name (English Name, Abbreviation)**  
Definition of the metric, its purpose, and contextual application.

**Calculation Methodology:**
- Formula: [brief mathematical expression or pseudocode]
- Range: [min‚Äìmax]
- Interpretation:
  - [value1]: [interpretation1]
  - [value2]: [interpretation2]
- Target threshold for DHAIE systems: [value]
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Priority & Timeline

**Priority:** `enhancement` (non-critical improvement)  
**Milestone:** Glossary v1.1  
**Dependencies:** Completion of metric formalization within the main DHAIE Concept documentation

---

## üìö Related Documents

- `docs/DHAIE-Concept-v3.md` ‚Äî core document describing system metrics  
- `docs/engineering_guidelines.md` ‚Äî operationalization of core principles  
- `glossary.md` ‚Äî current glossary version (1.0)

---

## üí° Notes

- This enhancement does **not** affect the current glossary quality (rating: 10/10).  
- Methodology details should be added **after** validation within the research phase of the project.  
- Maintain a balance between precision and accessibility for readers with different technical backgrounds.
