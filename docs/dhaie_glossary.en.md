## 1. Philosophical and Methodological Foundations

**DHAIE (Design Human AI Engineering and Enhancement)**  
A philosophical and engineering framework and research initiative for creating next-generation human-AI interfaces, based on principles of second-order cybernetics, enactivism, and assemblage theory. The goal is not design *for* users, but rather creating conditions for the mutual becoming of humans and artificial intelligence.

**Second-Order Cybernetics**  
The methodological foundation of DHAIE, studying the cybernetics of cybernetics‚Äîmechanisms by which an observer constructs observed systems. Asserts that the designer is inevitably part of the observed system, and the design process is an act of reality construction, not neutral observation.

**Enactivism**  
An approach to cognition asserting that cognition is not a representation of a pre-given world, but rather its enactment through a history of structural coupling and active interaction with the environment.

**Assemblage**  
A dynamic combination of heterogeneous elements (humans, machines, data, contexts) that enter into relations of mutual definition and create new emergent possibilities not reducible to the sum of properties of individual parts.

**Human-AI Assemblage Theory**  
A concept according to which humans and AI do not simply exchange information, but mutually constitute each other, forming a new, unified cognitive system‚Äîan assemblage.

**Mutual Becoming (Co-Formation)**  
A central process in DHAIE philosophy, describing the continuous transformation and mutual definition of human and AI, which do not remain static entities but coevolve through interaction, creating new joint capabilities.

**Structural Coupling**  
The process of mutual change and specification of systems through a prolonged history of interactions. In DHAIE, humans and AI do not simply exchange information, but mutually transform each other, coevolving.

**Coevolution**  
The process of reciprocal and joint evolution of humans and AI within an assemblage, in which both sides acquire new cognitive capabilities and possibilities.

**Autopoiesis**  
The capacity of a living or cognitive system to maintain and reproduce its own organization. In the DHAIE context, it is considered in relation to systems that can adapt their architecture and operational processes.

**Emergence**  
The arising of new, stable patterns of thinking, behavior, or problem-solving in a human-AI system that could not be predicted based on the sum of their individual strategies.

**Emergent Properties**  
New capabilities arising in a human-AI assemblage that exist neither in the human separately nor in the AI separately, but are generated precisely by their dynamic interaction.

**Emergent Modeling**  
An approach in DHAIE where new cognitive patterns and properties are not predetermined, but arise in the process of dynamic interaction and structural coupling of human and AI in an assemblage.

**Positive Spirals**  
A self-sustaining mechanism in a human-AI system where successful interaction leads to growth in capabilities of both participants, which in turn makes subsequent interactions even more effective.

**Microstrategies of Cognition**  
Formalized, individual patterns of **attention**, thinking and problem-solving, independent of specific content or domain. Formal structures organizing the thinking of a specific person (how they think), regardless of thought content (what they think). They are the object of design and detection in DHAIE reflexive interfaces.

**Post-Human Humanism**  
A philosophical position in DHAIE that, while not denying the value of human experience, asserts that its preservation and development in the AI era requires going beyond traditional anthropocentric notions and recognizing future intelligence as a joint project of humans and machines.

**Technological Mediation**  
A concept from philosophy of technology, adopted in DHAIE, asserting that technologies are not neutral intermediaries, but actively shape ways of understanding the world and influence the formation of human subjectivity.

**Technological Intentionalities**  
Directions of attention and action built into interfaces and algorithms that make some behavioral patterns easy and others difficult, thereby shaping user habits and expectations.

**Naive Objectivity**  
A notion criticized in DHAIE that a developer can occupy the position of an external, unbiased observer, designing solutions for users without influencing the very definition of the problem.

**Ontological Creativity**  
An approach in DHAIE viewing AI system design not as creating utilities, but as an act of constructing new ways of being-in-the-world and types of subjectivity.

## 2. Architecture and Systems

**5-Layer DHAIE Architecture**  
A multi-level model of a human-AI system, including:
1. **Perceptual Layer:** interpretation of context and intentions, accuracy of input data contextualization
2. **Reflexive Layer:** detection and adaptation of microstrategies
3. **Ethical Layer:** universal and context-dependent ethical alignment
4. **Emergent Layer:** detection of synergetic patterns
5. **Monitoring Layer:** observation of metrics and system state

> To implement key functions such as working with microstrategies and forming assemblages, the following specialized components are distinguished within the Reflexive and Emergent layers:

**Cognitive Pattern Layer**  
An architectural component within the Reflexive layer, responsible for extracting, modeling, and storing individual microstrategies of participant thinking. Includes components for microstrategy extraction, attention modeling, and temporal persistence.

**Reflexive Interface Layer**  
An architectural component ensuring observation of system processes, adaptive transparency, and assemblage formation. Includes components for metacognitive monitoring, adaptive transparency, and assemblage formation.

**Human-AI Coupling Layer**  
An architectural component within the Emergent layer where structural coupling of human and AI occurs, leading to the emergence of emergent properties and positive spirals of development.

**Reflexive Interfaces**  
Interfaces capable of observing, analyzing, and modifying their own logic and interaction principles based on user patterns and context. They not only perform functions, but also provide participants with the ability to observe, analyze, and modify processes of their operation, including adaptation logic and interpretation of user actions.

**Micro-strategy Technology**  
Technology within DHAIE for formalizing individual cognitive patterns, allowing creation of personalized cognitive interfaces that adapt to thinking processes, not just content preferences.

**Generative Cognitive Interfaces**  
A prospective concept in DHAIE describing interfaces for artificial general intelligence (AGI) that can not simply adapt ready-made elements, but create interfaces in real-time based on current cognitive needs and participant style.

**Adaptive Transparency**  
An architectural principle of DHAIE according to which the system dynamically regulates the level of disclosure of information about its internal processes depending on the cognitive readiness and interests of the participant.

**Cognitive Resonance**  
A state of interaction where the system recognizes and reproduces the participant's microstrategies, creating a sense that the system thinks similarly, which reduces cognitive load and accelerates understanding.

**Symmetric Interaction**  
A mode of DHAIE system operation where it recognizes and reproduces the participant's microstrategies, creating a sense of cognitive resonance.

**Complementary Interaction**  
A mode of DHAIE system operation where it introduces cognitive patterns complementing the participant's style, aiming to expand their thinking repertoire.

**Neurostiv Framework**  
An operational implementation of DHAIE principles and an open protocol for building adaptive human-AI teams, based on principles of neural connectivity and plasticity. It represents a dynamic system for self-organizing teams.
