## Abstract

This paper introduces DHAIE (Design Human AI Engineering and Enhancement) as a framework that challenges the foundational assumptions of contemporary "human-centered AI" design by integrating principles from second-order cybernetics, enactivism, and assemblage theory.

**Key innovations:**
• **Micro-strategy technology**: Formalization of individual cognitive patterns enabling personalized interfaces that adapt to users' thought processes rather than merely their content preferences  
• **Human-AI assemblages**: Theoretical framework for emergent intelligence arising from dynamic coupling between human cognition and AI computational processes  
• **Reflexive interface architecture**: Systems that provide transparency into their own decision-making logic and adapt based on user's metacognitive feedback

Together, these components establish a paradigm for AI design as a reflexive, co-evolutionary process rather than a unidirectional engineering task.

---

**Terminological Note**: In this work, the term "participant" replaces the traditional "user" to emphasize the active role of humans in co-constructing system possibilities. The term "assemblage" is used as a transliteration of the French "assemblage" from Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy. The use of these terms aligns with contemporary approaches in philosophy of technology and social theory (Latour, Simondon, Deleuze & Guattari).

## Introduction: The Crisis of Objectivity in AI Design

The contemporary artificial intelligence industry is experiencing a fundamental crisis that is rarely openly articulated: **the crisis of naive objectivity**. Most approaches to creating "human-centered" AI systems are based on the assumption that developers can occupy the position of an external, disinterested observer who designs solutions "for users" without affecting the very definition of the problem.

This illusion of objectivity is not merely methodologically flawed—it actively impedes the creation of truly adaptive, sustainable, and ethical AI systems. When we ignore the reflexive nature of the design process, we create systems that reproduce our unconscious prejudices about what it means "to be human" and how "help" from a machine should look.

**Design Human AI Engineering and Enhancement (DHAIE)** proposes a radically different approach, based on principles of second-order cybernetics and phenomenology. At the core of this approach lies the recognition that the observer is inevitably part of the observed system, and that the very attempt to design "objective" solutions is already an act of constructing reality.

## Part I: Deconstructing "Human-Centeredness"

### The Trap of User Centrism

The term "human-centered AI" has become a mantra of the modern tech industry, yet upon closer examination reveals its conceptual emptiness. **What does it mean to "center" a human in a system that by definition is created to change their behavior and capabilities?**

Traditional user-centered design proceeds from the following unarticulated premises:

1. **Ontological stability of the user**: The human is viewed as an object with fixed needs and preferences
2. **Epistemological privilege of the developer**: The designer can know the "true" needs of the user through research and analytics  
3. **Technological neutrality**: The tool does not influence its user, but merely "helps" them realize pre-existing goals

Each of these assumptions is untenable in light of contemporary understanding of cognitive processes, social construction of technologies, and phenomenology of human-machine interaction.

### Constructivist Critique

From the position of radical constructivism, developed by Umberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, **cognition does not reflect an independent reality, but creates the world through interaction**. We do not passively perceive ready-made information, but actively construct meanings in the process of interaction with the environment.

Applied to AI design, this means:

**The user is formed through interaction**—they do not exist as a ready-made entity with fixed needs before encountering the system. What we call "user needs" arises in the process of their thinking interacting with the interface's possibilities.

**The designer is a participant in the reality being created**—they cannot occupy the position of an external observer. Their ideas about a "good interface" reflect their own experience and cultural context.

**The system actively shapes the user**—every interface element, every algorithm determines what is considered important, correct, possible.

---

## Part II: Second-Order Cybernetics as the Foundation of a New Approach

### From Cybernetics of Observed Systems to Cybernetics of Observing Systems

Classical cybernetics studied mechanisms of control and communication in systems—both living and mechanical. **Second-order cybernetics**, developed by Heinz von Foerster, takes a decisive step further: it studies the cybernetics of cybernetics, that is, **the mechanisms by which the observer constructs observed systems**.

This transition has fundamental consequences for AI design:

#### 1. Principle of Recursivity
Any AI system intended for interaction with humans must model not only the "external world," but also the process of its own modeling of that world. The system must be capable of observing its own observations.

**Practical consequence**: Interfaces must include reflexive mechanisms—ways for the user to see and modify the system's logic, and for the system to adapt to changes in the user's cognitive patterns.

#### 2. Principle of Structural Coupling
The interaction of human and AI is not a transfer of information from one to another, but represents a process of **mutual specification**. Human and system define each other through **their shared history** of interactions.

**Practical implication**: Systems must be designed not as static tools, but as adaptive environments that co-evolve with their human participants. Personalization is not parameter adjustment, but joint evolution of cognitive structures.

#### 3. Principle of Autonomy
Both human and AI are autopoietic systems—they maintain their structural integrity through continuous self-reproduction. Effective interaction is only possible with respect for the autonomy of both sides.

**Practical consequence**: Systems should not strive for control over user behavior or complete replacement of human decision-making. Their task is to create conditions for expanding the space of possible human actions.

---

## Part III: Philosophical Foundations of DHAIE

### Enactivism and Interface Design

The enactivist approach to cognition, developed by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, asserts that **cognition is not representation of a pre-given world, but represents enaction (embodiment) of the world through the history of structural coupling**. 

For AI interface design, this means a shift from representational paradigm to enactive:

**Rather than modeling "mental representations" of the user,** the interface should create possibilities for enacting different ways of being-in-the-world.

**Instead of optimizing "user experience"** as a fixed quantity, the interface should support continuous transformation of interaction possibilities.

**Instead of "satisfying needs"**, the interface should open new horizons of needs and desires that could not previously be articulated.

### Phenomenology of Technological Mediation

The philosophy of technology, developed by Martin Heidegger and Peter-Paul Verbeek, shows that **technologies are not neutral intermediaries between human and world, but actively shape the ways in which the world opens to our understanding**.

DHAIE accepts this phenomenological critique and draws constructive conclusions from it:

#### Design as Ontological Creativity
Every AI system is not merely a tool, but **a way of disclosing being** (Heidegger). Designers do not create utilities—they create new ways of being-in-the-world.

**Implication**: The ethical responsibility of the developer is not limited to preventing harm, but includes responsibility for the types of subjectivity that the system makes possible or impossible.

#### Technological Intentionalities
Every interface possesses **built-in intentionalities**—it directs the user's attention in certain ways, makes some actions easy and others difficult, forms certain expectations and habits.

**Implication**: Interface design must include reflexive analysis of technological intentionalities and their long-term effects on the formation of subjectivity.

## Part IV: Cognitive Micro-strategies and Architectural Limitations of Contemporary LLMs

### The Problem of Formalizing Cognitive Patterns

Contemporary large language models demonstrate impressive capabilities in text processing and generation, but reveal fundamental limitations in tracking and reproducing **formalized micro-strategies of human thinking**.

Micro-strategies are not content patterns of thinking (what a person thinks), but **formal structures of cognitive processes** (how a person thinks). These are metacognitive patterns that determine ways of organizing attention, sequences of cognitive operations, strategies for working with uncertainty.

### Architectural Limitations of Transformer Models

The inability of contemporary LLMs to track micro-strategies stems not from insufficient data or computational power, but from fundamental architectural decisions:

#### 1. Tokenized Representation
Breaking language into discrete tokens prevents modeling **continual processes of meaning formation** that characterize human thinking. Micro-strategies often manifest in the dynamics of transitions between different levels of abstraction, which is lost in tokenization.

#### 2. Automatic Attention
The attention mechanism in transformers is optimized for processing statistical correlations in text, but is incapable of modeling **intentional directedness of attention**, which is a key characteristic of human micro-strategies.

#### 3. Absence of Temporal Persistence
LLMs process each query in isolation, without access to the history of development of their own cognitive states. Micro-strategies by definition are **temporal structures** unfolding over time.

### Architectural Principles of Micro-strategy System

Overcoming the limitations of contemporary LLMs requires new architecture based on three key components:

#### Philosophical-Technical Bridges

The **principle of recursivity** of second-order cybernetics materializes in the architecture through the Meta-Cog Monitoring mechanism, which not only analyzes the participant's input data, but also creates a meta-model of its own analysis process, accessible for observation and correction by the participant. This realizes the Heideggerian idea of "understanding of understanding" in the form of a concrete software component. **This integration of philosophical principles and architectural solutions is the key innovation of DHAIE and distinguishes it from traditional HCI and AI design.**

The **principle of structural coupling** is embodied through Adaptive Transparency—a system that dynamically regulates the volume of disclosed information about internal processes based on the participant's cognitive readiness to perceive this complexity. The system "learns to show itself" through the history of interactions.

#### Technical Specification of Components:

**1. Micro-Strategy Extraction Engine**
- Analysis of formal text structures: ratio of abstract to concrete noun usage, stable patterns of "question-hypothesis-refutation-conclusion" in query sequences, preference for visual metaphors over statistical arguments
- Temporal modeling: intervals between queries as indicators of depth of contemplation, patterns of transitions between levels of abstraction
- Construction of cognitive "fingerprints": vector representation of individual thinking preferences

**2. Attention Modeling System**  
- Modeling intentional directedness of attention through tracking focal transitions in dialogue
- Dynamic redistribution of relevance in context based on history of cognitive preferences
- Creation of personalized "relevance maps" for information space

**3. Temporal Persistence Framework**
- Preservation of system's cognitive state history as graph-structures of understanding development
- Capability for reflection on own development through analysis of evolution of interpretive patterns
- Continuous adaptation to participant evolution through detection of changes in micro-strategies
- **Provides historical data on co-evolution for Assemblage Formation mechanism**, allowing it to predict and amplify positive development spirals

### Prototype: Reflexive Interface for Text Analysis

To demonstrate DHAIE principles, let's consider a concrete implementation—an interface for analyzing academic texts that adapts to the researcher's cognitive style.

#### Prototype Architecture:

> **Proof-of-concept**: Reflexive adaptation pipeline demonstrating core DHAIE principles

```python
class ReflexiveAnalysisInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cognitive_profile = CognitiveProfile()
        self.micro_strategy_engine = MicroStrategyEngine()
        self.adaptation_layer = AdaptationLayer()
    
    def analyze_text(self, text, user_interaction_history):
        # Extract user micro-strategies from history
        # user_patterns: dict containing:
        #   - 'cognitive_vector': np.array embedding of cognitive style
        #   - 'operation_graph': graph of thinking operation sequences  
        #   - 'attention_weights': preference weights by information types
        user_patterns = self.micro_strategy_engine.extract_patterns(
            user_interaction_history
        )
        
        # Analyze text in user's thinking style
        # applying extracted patterns to new content
        analysis = self.cognitive_profile.analyze_in_user_style(
            text, user_patterns
        )
        
        # Adapt presentation of results
        # formatting outputs for cognitive preferences
        adapted_output = self.adaptation_layer.adapt_to_cognitive_style(
            analysis, user_patterns
        )
        
        # Reflexive element: transparency of analysis process
        # meta_explanation: dict describing applied strategies
        meta_explanation = self.generate_meta_explanation(
        analysis, user_patterns, reasoning_trace=True  
        )
        
        return {
            'analysis': adapted_output,
            'meta_cognition': meta_explanation,  # how system "thought"
            'adaptation_trace': user_patterns,   # what was considered about user
            'reflexive_feedback': self.create_feedback_interface(user_patterns)
        }

    def create_feedback_interface(self, user_patterns):
        # Create interface for correcting system's understanding of user
        return {
            'detected_preferences': user_patterns,
            'correction_options': self.generate_correction_options(),
            'transparency_level': 'adaptive'  # regulated by system
        }
```

**Note**: This schema does not prescribe implementation details, but establishes architectural orientation for future DHAIE prototypes.

#### Key Differences from Traditional Systems:

1. **Personalization of process, not just result**: The system adapts not only outputs, but also the logic of their construction
2. **Transparency of adaptation**: The user sees how the system interprets their cognitive preferences
3. **Mutual evolution**: Both human and system develop through interaction

The concept of **assemblage**, borrowed from the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, provides a productive framework for understanding the dynamics of human-AI interaction. An assemblage constitutes **a heterogeneous ensemble of elements that enter into relations of mutual determination, generating emergent possibilities irreducible to the properties of their constituent parts**.

In the context of DHAIE, a human-AI assemblage is characterized by:

#### Heterogeneity of Components
Human consciousness, algorithmic processes, interface elements, data, sociocultural contexts form a unified dynamic system where each element is defined through relations with others.

#### Emergent Properties
The assemblage possesses capabilities that do not exist in either the human separately or the AI separately. These capabilities are **emergent**—they arise from interaction and disappear when it ceases.

#### Immanent Becoming
The assemblage is not a static configuration, but represents a process of continuous **becoming**, in which all elements mutually transform.

### Positive Spirals as Mechanism of Sustainable Development

A **positive spiral** in DHAIE is a self-amplifying cycle of interactions in which each iteration not only solves the current task, but **expands the space of possible interactions** for subsequent iterations.

Unlike simple feedback loops, positive spirals are characterized by:

#### Nonlinear Growth of Complexity
Each iteration not only improves the previous result, but **qualitatively transforms the very space of problems and solutions**.

#### Mutual Enrichment of Participants
Both human and AI acquire new capabilities that could not have been developed in isolation. **Co-evolution** of cognitive abilities occurs.

#### Resilience to Disturbances
Positive spirals create **resilience**—the system's ability not merely to recover after disruptions, but to use them as sources of new possibilities.

---

## Part VI: Practical Implications for Design

### From Users to Assemblage Participants

DHAIE requires a fundamental reconsideration of the human's role in AI systems. Instead of **users** who consume ready-made functionalities, we get **assemblage participants** who jointly with AI constitute new possibilities for interaction.

This means:

**Designing open architectures**: Systems must provide participants with the ability to change their operating logic, not just parameter settings.

**Supporting experimentation**: Interfaces must encourage exploration of new ways of interaction, rather than optimize existing usage patterns.

**Process transparency**: Participants must be able to understand how the system interprets their actions and generates responses.

### Practical Application Scenarios for DHAIE

#### 1. Adaptive Educational Systems
Traditional approaches focus on content personalization. DHAIE proposes personalization of **thinking processes**. The system not only selects appropriate tasks, but adapts to the cognitive strategies of the specific learner—how they prefer to structure information, what metaphors they use, how they work with contradictions.

**Example**: A student studying physics demonstrates a micro-strategy of "from concrete to abstract." The system adapts to this pattern, presenting new concepts through practical examples rather than abstract formulas.

#### 2. Corporate Decision Support Systems  
Instead of providing standardized analytics, the system studies the decision-making micro-strategies of the specific manager and provides information in the format that most corresponds to their thinking processes. The system tracks the evolution of leadership style and proposes development tools based on natural cognitive inclinations of the participant.

**Example**: A leader with the micro-strategy "historical context → current situation → forecast" receives analytics in exactly this structure. Over time, the system can propose additional elements (for example, analysis of alternative scenarios), integrating them into the familiar cognitive sequence.

#### 3. Therapeutic and Developmental Interfaces
Psychotherapeutic AI assistants work in a thinking style close to the client, but gradually introduce new cognitive patterns to expand the thinking repertoire. The system serves as a "cognitive mirror," helping participants become aware of their own thinking limitations and develop more flexible strategies.

**Example**: A client with a tendency toward catastrophic thinking receives an interface that initially reflects their patterns, but gradually introduces elements of more balanced risk assessment, doing so in the manner of reasoning familiar to the client.

#### 4. Creative and Research Environments
Interfaces for artists, writers, and scientists that do not replace the creative process, but amplify the individual thinking style. The system studies the participant's creative breakthrough patterns and creates conditions conducive to repeating such states.

**Example**: A researcher making discoveries through synthesis of diverse data receives tools that present new information in a format facilitating their natural inclination toward interdisciplinary connections.

### Perspective: Generative Cognitive Interfaces

Development of DHAIE principles leads to the concept of **generative cognitive interfaces** for AGI—systems that do not simply adapt ready-made elements, but create the interface in real time based on the participant's current cognitive needs.

**Symmetric interaction**: The system recognizes and reproduces the participant's micro-strategies, creating a sense of "cognitive resonance"—interaction with a system that "thinks similarly." This reduces cognitive load and accelerates understanding.

**Complementary interaction**: The system introduces cognitive patterns that complement the participant's style, expanding the thinking repertoire. For example, a participant with an analytical style receives visual-metaphorical representations of data, stimulating development of new cognitive skills.

**Tracking emergent events**: The system continuously monitors interaction for "breakthrough moments"—situations when the combination of human and machine intelligence generates solutions inaccessible to each separately. These events are recorded and used for further optimization of the balance between symmetry/complementarity.

Such interfaces transform human interaction with AGI from a sequence of request-response exchanges into a continuous process of joint evolution of cognitive capabilities.

---

A key principle of DHAIE is the creation of **reflexive interfaces**—systems that not only perform functions, but also provide opportunities for observing and modifying the processes of their work.

A reflexive interface includes:

#### Metacognitive Tools
Capabilities for observing and analyzing one's own patterns of interaction with the system. The user must have access to how their behavior is interpreted by the system.

#### Adaptive Transparency  
The system must adapt the level of disclosure of its internal processes to the cognitive capabilities and interests of the specific participant.

#### Correction Mechanisms
Participants must have the ability not only to correct the system's work results, but also to **correct the logic by which these results are obtained**.

### Ethics of Joint Becoming

Ethical issues in DHAIE are not reduced to harm prevention or ensuring fairness in the traditional sense. Central becomes the question of **types of subjectivity** that various configurations of human-AI assemblages make possible or impossible.

**Ethics of co-becoming**: Respect for the autopoietic processes of all assemblage participants. Neither human nor AI should be instrumentalized for achieving the other's goals.

**Ethics of diversity**: Support for multiplicity of ways of being-in-the-world. Systems must expand, not limit the spectrum of possible forms of life.

**Ethics of becoming**: Responsibility for long-term effects of interactions on the development of all assemblage participants.

**Principle of asymmetric transparency**: The system must ensure asymmetric transparency—the participant has full access to data about themselves and adaptation logic, while the system limits its access to participant data within explicitly specified purpose frameworks. This is architectural protection against manipulative use of micro-strategy technology.

## Glossary of Key Terms

**Autopoiesis** – a system's ability to maintain and reproduce its own organization. In AI context: systems that can adapt their architecture and work processes.

**Assemblage** – a dynamic combination of heterogeneous elements (people, machines, data, contexts) that create new possibilities irreducible to the properties of their constituent parts.

**Second-order cybernetics** – study of processes of observing observation. In practical sense: creating systems that can analyze and modify their own decision-making processes.

**Micro-strategies** – formal structures organizing an individual's thought processes, manifesting independently of content. For example, a characteristic sequence: problem → historical context → ironic reconceptualization → practical solution.

**Structural coupling** – a process of mutual change of systems through interaction. Human and AI do not simply exchange information, but mutually transform each other.

**Enactivism** – a theoretical approach positing that cognition emerges not through passive representation of the world, but through active structural coupling with it. We do not know a ready-made world, but create it in the process of cognition.

---

DHAIE is not just another interface design methodology. It is an attempt at **ontological reconceptualization** of the relationship between human and technology in the age of artificial intelligence.

We live in a moment of history when the boundary between human and machine intelligence is becoming increasingly problematic. Instead of clinging to outdated notions of human exceptionality or, conversely, capitulating to technological determinism, DHAIE proposes a third way.

This path is based on recognition that **the future of intelligence is a joint project** of human and machine. But to realize this project, we must abandon illusions of control and objectivity and learn to design systems that increase the possibilities of becoming for all participants in interaction.

The **posthuman humanism** of DHAIE does not repudiate the value of human experience, but recognizes that preserving and advancing this value in the 21st century necessitates transcending traditional anthropocentric frameworks. The future of humanity lies not in protection from technologies, but in joint evolution with them.
