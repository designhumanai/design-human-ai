## üî∑ What is DHAIE?

**DHAIE** ‚Äî **Design Human AI Engineering and Enhancement** ‚Äî is a unique approach to AI development that places human development and sustainable systems at its core.

DHAIE combines:
- Engineering psychology and NLP techniques
- Cognitive micro-models for productive thinking
- Ethics and human-centered design principles
- Future economics concepts (D-economy framework)
- Positive spiral development theory for Human-AI collaboration

The project has been ongoing since 1995, authored by Viktor Savitsky.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Review `docs/overview.md` and `docs/principles.md`
2. Explore `models/` and `interfaces/` for examples and concepts
3. Join discussions:
   - Telegram group: [@dhaie_human_ai](https://t.me/dhaie_human_ai)
   - Discord server (by invitation)
4. Want to contribute? Read `contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md` and contact us

## üìà Current Focus (2025)

- Preparing scientific publication on DHAIE cognitive interfaces
- Structuring productive thinking models
- Visualizing D-economy concept
- Preparing GitHub Pages with documentation
- Seeking like-minded individuals and strategic partners

## üîç DHAIE Philosophical Position: Comparison of AGI Approaches

| Parameter | Philosophical Skepticism | AGI Industry (Engineering Approach) | DHAIE (Human-Centered Symbiosis) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **AGI as...** | Subject capable of universal meaning-generation without external context | System solving a wide range of tasks at human level | Co-evolutionary interface amplifying human potential |
| **Key Limitation** | Infinite Choice Barrier | Limitations in generalization, metacognition, embodiment | Misalignment between AI and human contexts |
| **Human Role** | Source of meaning, but AGI should be autonomous | Source of data, verification, corrections | Center of meaning assembly and co-development |
| **Conclusion** | AGI is impossible in principle | AGI is possible in engineering sense | AGI per se is not the goal ‚Äî interface alliance matters |
